# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Cap!

## Development setup

**Notes**:

- You need to have the latest release version of [Bun](https://bun.com/) installed. For WASM, Rust is also required.

- VSCode is the recommended IDE for working on Cap.

- For writing docs, make sure to place them inside of `docs/guide` and make sure to update the sidebar in `docs/.vitepress/config.mjs`.

Run `bun install` in each Bun package you want to work on to install dependencies.

## Tips

- Formatting uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/). Make sure there are no warnings or errors before submitting a PR.

- We prefer conventional commits, but they are not enforced. See [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for reference.

- No AI-generated code please. AI autocomplete is fine, but not fully AI code. If you submit AI-generated code without making it clear, it may be rejected.

- Type files are auto-generated from JSDoc comments

* Be respectful to others. Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
